## Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a desktop software by creating a user-friendly interface to launch and manage multiple mini-applications. The project utilizes a modern technology stack, including C++, Node.js, Electron, Vue, Vite, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, to ensure the application's high performance and good user experience.

## Key Features

- **Desktop Environment Simulation**: Provides an interface similar to traditional desktop operating systems, where users can view and launch various mini-applications.
- **Mini-application Management**: Users can quickly access and launch the following built-in mini-applications through the desktop interface:
  1. **Calculator**: A simple calculator app that supports basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Temperature Conversion**: Helps users convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
  3. **Prime Number Check**: Checks whether the input number is a prime.
  4. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: Generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
  5. **Guess the Number Game**: A simple number guessing game to test the user's guessing skills.
